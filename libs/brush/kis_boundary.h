/**
 * Generates an 'outline' for a paint device. It should look a bit like the outline of a
 * marching ants selection.
 *
 * It's not really optimized, so it's not recommended to do big things with it and expect
 * it to be fast.
 *
 * Usage: construct a KisBoundary, and then run a generateBoundary(w, h) on it. After that,
 * you can use the KisBoundaryPainter::paint method to let it paint the outline, or get a pixmap.
 *
 * If you are debugging the brush outlines, be aware that the pipeline for this
 * data is somewhat complex, involving such user classes:
 * KisBoundary, KisBrush, KisBrushBasedPaintOpSettings, KisTool, KisCurrentOutlineFetcher
