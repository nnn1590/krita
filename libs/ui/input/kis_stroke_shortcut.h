 * It transits between 3 states:
 *
 * Idle <-> Ready <-> Running
 *
 * The possibility of transition between Idle <-> Ready is defined
 * with a matchReady() method. The transition Ready <-> Running is
 * defined by matchBegin(). The Ready state is used for showing the
 * user the cursor of the upcoming action and the Running state shows
 * that the action linked to the shortcut should be activated.
