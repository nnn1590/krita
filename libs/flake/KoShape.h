/**
 * Base class for all flake shapes. Shapes extend this class
 * to allow themselves to be manipulated. This class just represents
 * a graphical shape in the document and can be manipulated by some default
 * tools in this library.
 *
 * Due to the limited responsibility of this class, the extending object
 * can have any data backend and is responsible for painting itself.
 *
 * We strongly suggest that any extending class will use a Model View
 * Controller (MVC) design where the View part is all in this class, as well
 * as the one that inherits from this one.  This allows the data that rests
 * in the model to be reused in different parts of the document. For example
 * by having two flake objects that show that same data. Or each showing a section of it.
 *
 * The KoShape data is completely in postscript-points (pt) (see KoUnit
 * for conversion methods to and from points).
 * This image will explain the real-world use of the shape and its options.
 * <img src="../flake_shape_coords.png" align=center><br>
 *  The Rotation center can be returned with absolutePosition()
 *
 * <p>Flake objects can be created in three ways:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>a simple new KoDerivedFlake(),
 *   <li>through an associated tool,
 *   <li>through a factory
 * </ul>
 *
 * <h1>Shape interaction notifications</h1>
 * We had several notification methods that allow your shape to be notified of changes in other
 * shapes positions or rotation etc.
 * <ol><li>The most general is KoShape::shapeChanged().<br>
 * a virtual method that you can use to check various changed to your shape made by tools or otherwise.</li>
 * <li>for shape hierarchies the parent may receive a notification when a child was modified.
 *  This is done though KoShapeContainerModel::childChanged()</li>
 * <li>any shape that is at a similar position as another shape there is collision detection.
 * You can register your shape to be sensitive to any changes like moving or whatever to
 * <b>other</b> shapes that intersect yours.
 * Such changes will then be notified to your shape using the method from (1) You should call
 * KoShape::setCollisionDetection(bool) to enable this.
 * </ol>
