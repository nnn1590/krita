 * a GUI for configuring newly created shapes as created by a KoShapeFactoryBase.
 *
 * Every time after a shape is created the KoShapeFactoryBase for that shape-type
 * will be queried for all the config widgets; both factory specific as well as
 * those set by the hosting application.
 * A dialog will be shown with all those panels, each extending this class.
 * The framework will then call open() to populate the widget with data from
 * the param shape.  After the user ok-ed the dialog the save() will be called
 * to allow the widget to apply all settings from the widget to the shape.
