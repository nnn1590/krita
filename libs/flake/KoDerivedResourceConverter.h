/**
 * \class KoDerivedResourceConverter
 *
 * Defines the abstraction of a derived resource. It should be
 * uploaded to the KoResourceManager during the loading phase.
 * The manager will use it to convert values to/from the source
 * resource.
 *
 *  "Derived" resources are the resources that do not exist temselves.
 *  Instead they are contained in some other resources and are updated
 *  synchronously with the parent resources as well.
 *
 *  E.g. we store opacity and composite op and opacity in the current
 *  paintop preset, which is also a resource. So composite op and opacity
 *  are "derived" resources.
 *
 *  The main goal of this class is to make our resources comply with
 *  a general Model-View-Controller architecture:
 *
 *  Model: KisPaintOpPreset. It stores opacity, composite op, eraser mode
 *         and other "global" properties.
 *
 *  Controller: KoCanvasResourceManager. It controls access to the resources
 *              and emits notification signals when they are changed.
 *
 *  View: KisPaintOpBox and other classes that show the resources on screen
 *
 *  Please take into account that according to the MVC design all the access
 *  to the model resources should be performed through the controller.
 *
