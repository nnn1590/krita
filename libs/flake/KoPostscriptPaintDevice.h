/**
 * Helper class to disable any screen conversion as that is done in flake.
 *
 * Flake has the property that all content is always defined in pts. And only when it
 * is displayed is it converted to the proper zoom and resolution.
 *
 * This is in contradiction to the normal behavior of Qt fonts which automatically
 * applies DPI on creation.  So this is where this special paint device comes in.
 *
 * Usage;
 *
 * For all QFont() and QFontMetrics constructors add an instance of this PaintDevice
 * to the constructor if those fonts are to be used for painting in a KoShape inheriting
 * class.
 *
 * Note: never try to actually paint on this paint device, since that will noisily crash.
