/**
 * This class is the object that explains how a shape is anchored to something.
 *
 * The anchored shape will be positioned (in supporting applications) based on the properties
 * defined in this class.
 *
 * This class can be used in three different ways:
 *  -page anchor
 *  -as-char
 *  -char, paragraph anchor
 *
 * If it's a page anchor it just provide the info about how the shape relates to a page with a specific
 * page number.
 *
 * For the other types of anchoring it has to have a TextLocation in a QTextDocument. This TextLocation
 * can either be an inline character (type as-char) or a position (type char or paragraph) The
 * KoShapeAnchor and TextLocation connects the anchored-shape to the text flow so the anchored shape
 * can be repositioned on the canvas if new text is inserted or removed before the anchor character.
 *
 * For as-char, char and paragraph use cases:
 * @see KoAnchorInlineObject
 * @see KoAnchorTextRange
 * which are both implemented as subclasses of TextLocation
 *
 * The position of the shape relative to the anchor is called the offset.
 * @see PlacementStrategy for more information about the layout of anchors/shapes.
