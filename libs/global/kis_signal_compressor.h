/**
 * Sets a timer to delay or throttle activation of a Qt slot. One example of
 * where this is used is to limit the amount of expensive redraw activity on the
 * canvas.
 *
 * There are four behaviors to choose from.
 *
 * POSTPONE resets the timer after each call. Therefore if the calls are made
 * quickly enough, the timer will never be activated.
 *
 * FIRST_ACTIVE_POSTPONE_NEXT emits the first signal and postpones all
 * the other actions like in POSTPONE. This mode is
 * used e.g. in move/remove layer functionality. If you remove a
 * single layer, you'll see the result immediately. But if you want to
 * remove multiple layers, you should wait until all the actions are
 * finished.
 *
 * FIRST_ACTIVE emits the timeout() event immediately and sets a timer of
 * duration \p delay. If the compressor is triggered during this time, it will
 * wait until the end of the delay period to fire the signal. Further events are
 * ignored until the timer elapses. Think of it as a queue with size 1, and
 * where the leading element is popped every \p delay ms.
 *
 * FIRST_INACTIVE emits the timeout() event at the end of a timer of duration \p
 * delay ms. The compressor becomes inactive and all events are ignored until
 * the timer has elapsed.
 *
 * The current implementation allows the timeout() to be delayed by up to 2 times
 * \p delay in certain situations (for details see cpp file).
