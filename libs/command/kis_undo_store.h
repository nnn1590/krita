/**
 * See also: https://community.kde.org/Krita/Undo_adapter_vs_Undo_store
 *
 * Split the functionality of KisUndoAdapter into two classes:
 * KisUndoStore and KisUndoAdapter. The former one works as an
 * interface to an external storage of the undo information:
 * undo stack, KisDocument, /dev/null. The latter one defines the
 * behavior of the system when someone wants to add a command. There
 * are three variants:
 *    1) KisSurrogateUndoAdapter -- saves commands directly to the
 *       internal stack. Used for wrapping around legacy code into
 *       a single command.
 *    2) KisLegacyUndoAdapter -- blocks the strokes and updates queue,
 *       and then adds the command to a store
 *    3) KisPostExecutionUndoAdapter -- used by the strokes. It doesn't
 *       call redo() when you add a command. It is assumed, that you have
 *       already executed the command yourself and now just notify
 *       the system about it. Warning: it doesn't inherit KisUndoAdapter
 *       because it doesn't fit the contract of this class. And, more
 *       important, KisTransaction should work differently with this class.
 *
 * The ownership on the KisUndoStore (that substituted KisUndoAdapter
 * in the document's code) now belongs to the image. It means that
 * KisDocument::createUndoStore() is just a factory method, the document
 * doesn't store the undo store itself.
