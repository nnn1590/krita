/**
 * \brief The KisTagToolButton class manages the logic of the tag management popup.
 *
 * This class is responsible for the GUI for creating, renaming and removing tags.
 * Since both renaming and removing is context-dependent (it depends on which tag
 * is currently selected in the combobox), all actions emit signals to the TagChooserWidget
 * for it to handle actual creationg, renaming and removal of tags in the KisTagModel.
