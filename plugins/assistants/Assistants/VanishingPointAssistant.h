/* Design:
 *The idea behind the vanishing point ruler is that in a perspective deformed landscape, a set of parallel
 *lines al share a single vanishing point.
 *Therefore, a perspective can contain an theoretical infinite of vanishing points.
 *It's a pity if we only allowed an artist to access 1, 2 or 3 of these at any given time, as other
 *solutions for perspective tools do.
 *Hence a vanishing point ruler.
 *
 *This ruler is relatively simple compared to the other perspective ruler:
 *It has only one vanishing point that is required to draw.
 *However, it does have it's own weaknesses in how to determine onto which of these infinite rulers to snap.
 *Furthermore, it has four extra handles for adding a perspective ruler to a preexisting perspective.
