/* The assistant tool allows artists to create special guides on the canvas
 * to help them with things like perspective and parallel lines
 * This tool has its own canvas decoration on it that only appears when the tool
 * is active. This decoration allows people to edit assistant points as well as delete assistants
 * Many of the operations here are forwarded on to another class (kis_painting_assistant_decoration)
 * that stores the assistant information as well as the decoration information with lines
 *
 * Drawing in two separate classes creates an issue where the editor controls in this class
 * are covered by the kis_painting_assistant_decoration class. In the future, we probably need to
 * do all the drawing in one class so we have better control of what is in front
