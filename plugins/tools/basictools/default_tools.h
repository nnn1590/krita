 * Despite the fact that new tools are created for every new view,
 * it is not possible to make tools standard parts of the type of the
 * imagesize plugin, because we need to create a new set of tools for every
 * pointer device (mouse, stylus, eraser, puck, etc.). So this plugin is
 * a module which is loaded once into Krita. For every tool there is a factory
 * class that is registered with the tool registry, and that is used to create
 * new instances of the tools.
