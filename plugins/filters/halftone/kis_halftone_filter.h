/**
 * @brief The kisHalftoneFilter class
 * This filter will allow the user to input an image and have it be approximated with
 * a halftone pattern. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halftone
 *
 * The primary usecase of such a filter is for specialized printing techniques, but for
 * many people the half-tone pattern also serves as a neutral pattern that is more pleasant
 * than plain flat look. The half tone in this case also becomes a stylistic technique.
 *
 * Based on that, there's a few ways a user could want to use this technique:
 * 1. Per-component. Per patch, each component will have a halftone approximated.
 * 2. Intensity only. The relative luminosity of the patch is determined and will be used
 * for the approximation, resulting in a black/white pattern.
 * 3. Intensity and then two colors mapped to the black/white pattern.
 *
 * On top of that, the pattern can be rotated, the shape can be chosen, and the user will want to
 * decide whether or not to use antialiasing(as printers themselves give
 * inefficient results with anti-aliasing).
 *
 * As of currently, 2 and 3 can be done. 1 is not impossible to code with some creative usage of composite
 * modes, but might be a little slow.
